# Categorical_Learning
Matlab codes for the final project in the course: The Application of Neural Networks in Psychology

## Description
In this project, I examined how people learn dynamically-changing categoreis using two computational models: the Generalized Context Model (GCM; Nosofsky, 1986) and the Attention Learning Covering Map (ALCOVE; Kruschke, 1992). Computational data simulations were conducted and the results were compared to actual human perforance in previous studies (Navarro & Perfor, 2009, 2012).
